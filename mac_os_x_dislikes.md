# Mac OS X Dislikes

## Apple knows best

* Unable to turn off the startup sound.
* Resizing a window requires tediously finding the edge. (Linux: Alt middle click anywhere on the window.)
* You can only resize active windows.
* Moving a window can only be done from the title bar (or pulling crosswise on the resize pointer). (Linux: alt left click anywhere on the window.)
* Only one window can be maximized at once (no way to have one on each monitor).
* The pulsing button doesn't have the focus.
* Command takes the place of a lot of Control but not all.
* Command and Option (sorta) replace Alt. This is supposed to be easier/friendlier?!
* The menu bar only shows up on the primary monitor.
* Alt tabbing to a program brings all windows to the front, but clicking on one does not.
* Alt-tab popup doesn't appear on the monitor with focus.
* The General/Appearance color has to be set to Blue in order to have red/yellow/green buttons in the window title bar.
* Windows don't snap to edges.
* Expose doesn't unhide windows.
* Can't wake up with the mouse.
* Can't drag and drop selected text in a text area (longclicks sorta work, sometimes).
* Menu navigation with keyboard doesn't wrap around top and bottom.
* Green button in menu bar has unpredictable results.
* A new monitor/keyboard/mouse doesn't inherit previous settings.
* Can't map Caps Lock to Escape.
* Rename not an option from the right click menu of a file
* Cursor doesn't change, but you can still resize a window by the fullscreen icon.
* Command-` is round robin, while command-tab is most recently used.
* Menu shortcuts use symbols for shift, control and option, but the keyboard doesn't.
* You can quit all the windows and yet still have focus
* Have to turn on tabbing through inputs on forms
* I can alt tab to the Finder even though it has no open windows and can't be quit (nor removed from the dock).
* Can't change volume by hovering over the sound icon and scrolling your mouse wheel (have to click).
* After downloading and installing something, you don't know what to do next to run it.
* It won't let you run stuff you download and install until you track it down and command click it.
* back/forward buttons don't work on external mouse
* Home doesn't work on external keyboard
* Numlock on external keyboard doesn't work as I'd expect
* No middle click with magic mouse (and no cusotmization options)
* No fewer bugs than other OSes.

## Apps

* The app store has never had anything I've wanted.
* No office suite preinstalled.
* Finder: home isn't in your favorites list by default
* Spotlight: If you type 'Finder' the Finder is not an option.
* Chrome: Can't change tabs with scroll wheel.
* Notes: You can't search the text of a note?!
* iTerm: No easy way to switch to open profile.
* Messages: painful

## It's not Linux

* Activity monitor widget is quite lame
* Can't click on links in the terminal (iTerm)
* No readline
* rgrep not preinstalled
* Doesn't autoload ~/bin
* Scroll doesn't work in terminal vim

# Likes

* Nice hardware (Macbook Pro).
* I can have 3 monitors without fighting with xorg.
